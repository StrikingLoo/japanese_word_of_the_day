# Random Japanese Word -- Japanese Word of the Day!
This minimal script samples a random word from a dataset, and outputs its kanji, hiragana and meaning.
I'm using a N3 dataset (attached here) but it should be easy to replace it with any other JLPT level's dataset.

All of the vocab datasets are available at [tanos](http://www.tanos.co.uk/jlpt/sharing/)' website. 
His license allows for non-commercial use.

Usage: change the absolute file path for the vocabulary CSV to the one on your PC. 
run `python wotd_jp.py`
